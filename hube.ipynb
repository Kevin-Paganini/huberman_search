I describe how dopamine-- a chemical we all make in our brain, underlies our desire for and pursuit of our goals, as well as our capacity to move and experience pleasure. I describe how we can leverage specific behaviors, reward schedules and dopamine-prolactin balance to help ensure we can maintain motivation and capacity for pleasure over the long term. I also discuss dopamine in the context of ADHD, craving and addiction, and some absolutely amazing results about specificity of drug effects based purely on belief.\n",

      "5. Quit smoking and avoid vaping: Smoking and vaping can negatively impact cardiovascular health and contribute to erectile dysfunction.\n",

There are things associated with smoking and with vaping and other means of getting nicotine into our system that have their own effects, both negative, and in some cases positive. Indeed later, we will talk about how you can actually use nicotine to get over smoking addiction.

      "1. Enhances Attention, Focus, and Alertness: Nicotine is known to improve cognitive functions, particularly attention, focus, and alertness.

      "In this episode, I discuss cannabis (aka marijuana), including the biological mechanisms underlying its effects on the mind and body, its known medical applications, its impact on libido, creativity, hunger, hormones and more. I also cover the known adverse health consequences of chronic and even acute (one-time) use and the factors that determine if cannabis is helpful or harmful. Additionally, I detail how the various strains of cannabis: sativa, indica and hybrid strains, can produce such divergent effects depending on the strain type, THC-to-CBD ratio, total dosage, and frequency of use. I review why cannabis can impact speech patterns and one’s propensity to develop anxiety/depression during and after use and, in some individuals, paranoia. As the legal landscape for cannabis is rapidly evolving, this episode should interest a wide audience, including former/current cannabis users, those in the medical, sports, law enforcement, and educational communities and, of course,\n",

There are clear data pointing to negative health effects of cannabis use and THC use, which again, is not to say that there are not positive effects on mood, anxiety, pain relief, et cetera.

      "\n",
      "1. Mood enhancement: Marijuana can help improve mood and reduce symptoms of anxiety and stress.\n",
      "2. Pain relief: Marijuana has been shown to have analgesic properties and can help alleviate chronic pain.\n",
      "3. Creativity: Some people report increased creativity and enhanced problem-solving abilities after using marijuana.\n",
      "4. Appetite stimulation: Marijuana can increase appetite and help alleviate symptoms of conditions like anorexia and cachexia.\n",
